## Description
<div style="text-align: justify">This is a banchelor's research topic, also a research project of my research group in Zhejiang University. In this project, I designed a phase-shift full-bridge converter with power rate of 200W. The converter is connected at the end of a PV string to compensate the string voltage.</div>

## Work fulfilled
* Modeled and Analyzed the voltage compensator in photovoltaic system.
* Designed a STM32F407 minimum system, which is a small but powerful control-board stick on the power board.
* Designed a phase shifting full bridge (PSFB) converter and did verification experiments.

## Prototype
* PSFB converter
