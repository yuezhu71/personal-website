## Description
<div style="text-align: justify">This is a banchelor's research topic, also a research project of my research group in Zhejiang University. In this project, I designed a phase-shift full-bridge converter with power rate of 300W. The converter is connected at the end of a PV string to compensate the string voltage.</div>  <br>

## Works fulfilled
* Modeled and Analyzed the voltage compensator in photovoltaic system.
* Designed a phase shifting full bridge (PSFB) converter and did verification experiments.
