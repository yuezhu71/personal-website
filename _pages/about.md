<!--<div style="text-align: justify"> I am a researcher in electrical engineering.</div> -->

##  BIO
<div style="text-align: justify"> I am an Assistant Professor (under the<a href="https://www.cityu.edu.hk/vpti/paps/"> Presidential Assistant Professor scheme</a>) in the <a href="https://www.ee.cityu.edu.hk/">Department of Electrical Engineering</a>, City University of Hong Kong (CityUHK). Prior to joining CityUHK, I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate in Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London.</div>

## RESEARCH
<div style="text-align: justify"> My research focuses on several key issues related with stability of electric power systems that are dominated by inverter-based resources (IBR), including:</div>

* Dynamics and stability analysis of IBR-dominated power systems.
* Grid-following and grid-forming IBR control optimisation.
* Data-driven on-line system modelling and monitoring enhanced by AI/ML.
* Comprehensive system strength assessment for new IBR connection.
* Tools development, including software and experimental test bench, for research on new electricity system.
