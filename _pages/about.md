<div style="text-align: justify"> Hi, welcome to my personal website. I'm Yue Zhu, a researcher in electrical engineering. This website is built to display my academic career, blogs, and sometimes to share my personal moments.</div>


##  About Me
<div style="text-align: justify"> I'm now a postdoctoral research associate at Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London. My research focuses on stability analysis of power systems with high penetrations of inverter-based resources (IBRs), including impedance-based stability analysis, impedance measurement technologies, and grid strength assessment. Besides, I have experience in designs/applications of power hardware-in-the-loop, rapid-control prototyping, power electronic converters and power line communication. I am proficient in Matlab programming, Simulink, RT-LAB (Opal-RT technologies), PCB design and MCU (ARM, DSP, Arduino) programming. I am also a research member of Integrated Development of Low-carbon Energy Systems (IDLES) program at Imperial College.</div>
