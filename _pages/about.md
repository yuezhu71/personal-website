<div style="text-align: justify"> I am a researcher in electrical engineering.</div>


##  About Me
<div style="text-align: justify"> I'm an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering, City University of Hong Kong (CityUHK). Prior to joining CityUHK, I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate in Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London.

## Research
My research focuses on several key issues related with stability of the new-type power systems which are dominated by inverter-based resources (IBR), including:
* Power system dynamics and stability: small-signal stability mainly.
* Grid-following and grid-forming IBR control optimisation.
* Data-driven on-line system modelling and monitoring enhanced by AI/ML.
* Comprehensive system strength assessment for new IBR connection.
* Tools development, including software and experimental test bench, for research on new-type power systems.
